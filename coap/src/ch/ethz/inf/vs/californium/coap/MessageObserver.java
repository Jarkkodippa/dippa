/**
 * The observer interface for receiving events on a message.
 * <p>
 * The following methods are called
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #responded(Response)} when a response arrives</li>
 * <li> {@link #acknowledged()} when the message has been acknowledged</li>
 * <li> {@link #rejected()} when the message has been rejected</li>
 * <li> {@link #timeouted()} when the client stops retransmitting the message and
 * still has not received anything from the remote endpoint</li>
 * <li> {@link #canceled()} when the message has been canceled</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class that is interested in processing a message event either implements
 * this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
 * {@link MessageObserverAdapter} class (overriding only the methods of
 * interest).
 * <p>
 * The observer object created from that class is then registered with a message
 * using the message's {@link Message#addMessageObserver(MessageObserver)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is unrelated to CoAP's observe relationship between an
 * endpoint and a resource. However, when a request establishes a CoAP observe
 * relationship to a resource which sends notifications, the method
 * {@link #responded(Response)} can be used to react to each such notification.
